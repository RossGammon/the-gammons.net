Isabella RAEPER was born on 6th April 1904 at 3 Gladstone Lane, Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, United Kingdom. Her parents were Alexander RAEPER and Jane STEWART.

At some point, her family moved to Aberdeen. In 1934, Isabella migrated to Australia to help rear the child (Margaret) of her sister Margaret, who died in childbirth. She was living at 1 Granton Place, Aberdeen, Scotland, United Kingdom just before she emigrated. At the time of her marriage, she was living at Logan House, Toorak Road, South Yarra, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Married life
------------

Francis and Isabella were married on the 21st September 1940 at the Thomson Memorial Presbyterian Church, Ormond, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. At the time of their marriage, Francis was living at 38 Stuart Street, Armadale, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Francis and Isabella had two children, Frances and Edwin. They lived in Box Hill, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Francis was the gardner for various people. Important clients were Mr Sparks who was a local councillor and owned a nursery, Mr Judkins who was a doctor, and Mr Reid who was a Member of Parliament and regularly opened Carols By Candelight and lived in North Balwyn. Francis was allowed to use a property in Middleborough Road for cultivating plants until Liverpool Road in Kilsyth was bought in about 1952. In 1956, the family moved up to Blythe Road on Mount Dandenong.

The latter years
----------------

In the 1960's, Francis and Isabella moved to 38 Durham Raod, Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia. A pet cockatoo that was kept in the backyard at Kilsyth is a favourite memory for me in my childhood, as well as helping/hindering Grandad (Francis) as he tinkered away in the shed. When visiting, I remember playing vinyl records, and going through all of Grandma's (Isabella) memorabilia of Scotland.

Francis GAMMON died on the 24th September 1983, in Box Hill, Victoria. Isabella continued to live in Durham Road for a while, but eventually moved to the nearby Kirkbrae retirement home. It was my pleasure to pick her up most Sundays in my new car, and bring her home to join in the family activities. She died on the 3rd December 1989 at the retirement home, Kirkbrae, Mt Dandenong Road, Kilsyth, Victoria. Australia.
