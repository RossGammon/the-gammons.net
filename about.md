*Welcome to Ross Gammonâ€™s Family History Website.*

I have been researching my family tree since late 2004. For reasons of privacy and security, I will not be publishing details of any relatives that are still alive.

My hope is that members of my family will be able to refer to the website to see where the research has got to. My weblog [rossgammon68.wordpress.com](https://rossgammon68.wordpress.com/) can be used to make comments on the website and feedback suggestions. Alternatively, I hope that keen family members can conribute to the website using [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the [Github repository](https://github.com/RossGammon/the-gammons.net).

I am also conducting a One Name Study on the Gammon surname. A broad outline of the study can be found [here](http://one-name.org/name_profile/gammon/).
