Over the last few months, when I had the chance, I tidied up my Grandfather and Grandmother's data in my Gramps Family Tree database. Today, I managed to finish the page for my Grandad, [Francis Gammon (b. 1899)](http://the-gammons.net/gammon/1899_francis_gammon).

Most of the early information about my grandparents comes from the [Government Record Office (GRO)](https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/) in England and the [Scotlands People](https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/) website. The more recent information about their lives in Australia comes from an interview with Dad when he came to Europe for my wedding in 2005.
