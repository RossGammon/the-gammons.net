A long time ago, when I was using Windows and busy researching my Family History, I created this website using a product called Netobjects Fusion. Back in 2010, I switched to using Linux and was no longer able to edit the website.

Finally, I have converted the website to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This allows me to edit the website on my Linux computers, and store it in my favourite version control system (git) online at [Github](https://github.com/RossGammon/the-gammons.net/). This has the added advantage that other family members can access the source, and contribute information and changes using well documented processes. It also means that once I am no longer, somebody can fork the repository, push it to a different server on the internet, and carry on publishing further research.

At the moment, I am using a very plain theme. I will investigate a prettier theme at some point, and switch to that. Enjoy!
