# the-gammons.net
This is my personal Family History website.

It was created by using [HTTrack Website Copier](https://www.httrack.com/) to clone my old website (originally created with Netobjects Fusion). The website has now been converted to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It also uses the Jekyll blog functionality so that every major update can be announced in the "News" feed, and people can monitor that for updates.

The website source is now stored online in my [Github repository](https://github.com/RossGammon/the-gammons.net/). This allows other family members to contribute information & corrections directly. This can be done on the Github website, by editing the files online and creating a Pull Request, or by creating an Issue for me to fix.

Alternatively, contributions can be produced locally by cloning the git repository. See the INSTALL file for instructions.
