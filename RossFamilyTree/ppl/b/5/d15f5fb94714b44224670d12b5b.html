				William Saltmarsh <br />
				William Saltmarsh with a companion, was charged at Kingston, Surrey, on28th March 1785 on two counts, first on suspicion of theft from a shop inPutney and second theft of 5 handkerchiefs, 3 cotton and 2 silk, from theshop. He was sentenced to 76 years transportation and sent to the hulksfrom Southwark goal on the 2nd of June 1786, received on the Ceres hulk,aged 15 years, and removed to the Justitia hulk on 16th August. On 6thJan 1787 he was delivered to Alexander. Described as a labourer, he hadbeen living in the parish of Putney before his arrest. <br />
				At Port Jackson he worked as a cooper, first in the commissary?s storesand later at the wharf. On 11th Aug 1788, accused of theft of spiritsafter being found drunk, he was sentenced to 50 lashes. On 6th June 1789he was responsible for capturing the renegade black convict John Caesar{qv}, who had absconded and was raiding the settlement for food. On 3rdOctober he was accused with James Richards {qv} of stealing oars fromLieutenant Ralph Clark?s boat, and for this he was sentenced to 50 lasheson the 13th. A daughter Ann by Elizabeth {qv} was baptized on 20thDecember 1789. <br />
				In 1790 he was sent to Norfolk Island by Surprise. He seems not to havebeen associated with his daughter and her mother, who had gone there inMarch 1790. On 1st July 1791 he had cleared one rod of a Sydney Town lot,on which he was subsisting himself and one person possibly Mary Butler{Lady Juliana, age 15 years on embankment in 1789}. In April 1792 he hadbeen detected in a theft, for which he receive 100 lashes and was orderedto work in a goal gang ?during pleasure? {I.e. for an indefinite period}.His confinement was short: he left the Island for Bengal by Pitt on 7thMay 1792, Lieutenant Governor King writing of him that he was justanother scoundrel?. He abandoned Mary Butler who bore him a son Williamon 13th August 1792. William Saltmarsh Jr. aged 20 yr. in 1812, leftNorfolk Island for Port Calrymple on February 1813 by Minstrel; he latermarried Elizabeth Steven {Riley} daughter of Mary Phillips {qv}. It isthought that William Saltmarsh Sr. drowned at sea on his way to India. <br />
				Letter written by Governor King regarding Norfolk Island. <br />
				Accusation is theft, or any other capital crime, and if the culprit isfound guilty the examination is laid before me with the Justices opinionpointing out what ever may serve to extenuate or aggravate thecircumstances. I then give the sentence and order the punishment to beinflicted, which is more or less serve, according to the nature of thecrimes, and other circumstances, a proper regard is also had to thegeneral conduct of the offenders. Each of the above gentlemen take it inturns to be the sitting Justice for the week, to hear all complaints andto decide upon them, or to refer the hearing of them to the followingSaturday. <br />
				This Sir is the only regular mode I could in my situation adopt. Most ofthe convict who came out on the First Fleet and whose terms oftransportation are expired have either become settlers, gone off thestore, or continued working for government. Among this description ofpeople is one who has applied to go off the store and to work for asettler to gain his living, this man was soon after detected in stealinga sack of maize from the public ground. {this is one instance among anumber of similar thefts}. As it was necessary to make an example and toexclude this wretch who is a hardened thief from returning to England topester Society. I mean to send him to Port Jackson, to take his trial atthe criminal court there but the misfortune that will attend his beingsent there is that two settlers must go with him as evidence and anotherto prosecute which will be a considerable detriment and discouragement tothose people. Although they will have assistance from the public to keeptheir ground in order during their absence. And I much fear theinconvenience these people lay {to place, put, or be in a particularstate or position} under may be a means of preventing culprits beingbrought to justice. <br />
				I have entered into this detail in order to inform you of the state ofthis Island and those under my charge and beg to submit the whole to yourconsideration. I cannot close this part of my letter without adding thatthe general behavior of the convicts is much more regular and quiet thanmight be expected from them and that the thefts are confined t aparticular description of wretches, with whom stealing is as habitual astheir desire of eating. I hope Sir that it will not be thought presumingor anticipating to request some court of Judicature being established onthis Island for the more speedy bringing offenders to justice and toprevent the commission of crimes, by the examples of proper and legalpunishment. I have the honor to be with great respect. <br />
				Dear Sir <br />
				Your <br />
				Most Obedient <br />
				Humble Servant <br />
				Phillip Gidley King <br />
				Letter to Nepean from Governor King regarding Norfolk Island. <br />
				Norfolk Island May 8th 1792 <br />
				Dear Sir <br />
				As my public letter will give you every information respecting thepresent state of the Island. I shall preface this by my best wishes foryour health and that of your family. <br />
				I hope the step will be approved of that I have taken <br />
				respecting purchasing the breeding stock and the over plus {plenty} corn,which were in our present situation independently reaping withoutsubjecting those on the Island to the greatest inconvenience by the stockbeing sold, ______ ______ <br />
				Which must have been the case, and as it now stands, the stock is equallydivided and will enable the settlers to go off the store at the presentedtime. The money that has been paid for the breeding stock to those whomonopolized them, has enabled them to purchase a great number of usefulthings that they stood much in want of and will create such a spirit ofindustry that will rapidly advance the independence of this Island forprovisions. <br />
				The Pitt has a number of articles that the Island is much in want of, butI didn?t think it necessary to take a ______ of that kind on myself,particularly as Governor Phillips told me that a Store ship would soonarrive - I?m purchasing a few real necessaries for my family. I have sunka twelve months pay and that for nothing. <br />
				Another circumstance which sufficiently satisfied me in having purchasedthe husk is, that most of these convicts who are out of their time andwho have hoarded from 20 - 30 pounds to pay their passages home havespent it in luxuries and necessaries , which will prolong their time ofreturn, for return when they will, they are sure of being hung or _______this side of the G Cole - As I remarked in my letter to Mr. Dundop. <br />
				I believe that a great part of these convict settlers have no <br />
				after idea than to realize, money enough to tempt some masters of a shipto carry them from here, but it will not be such a man as Manning. He hasonly taken two away who are real pests to the Island. One of them was asettler and in possession of his grant but has given it up, he is alawyer and has taken some trouble to be troublesome. I am therefore gladhe is gone. Should he ever come under your cognizance again, his name isWilliam Holmes, about five feet four inches high, and I hope will not besuffered to pester this part of the world again. Nothing but the want ofsome regular law has preventing my hanging him. <br />
				The other whose name is Saltmarsh is just another scoundrel. I have keptthirty more on the Island who could have got a way if I had not desiredManning not to take them, which he has not done. A little offered from 20- 30 pounds a piece. This has occasioned a little heat, but it will soonbe over. <br />
				I have heard it rumored but not from Governor Phillips that Clarke ofDeputy Commissary is to be sent here. I do not know what is to become ofFreeman, he is certainly learning and has been very attentive and activehere. I therefore hope he will not be forgot. <br />
				Mr. Chapman who I have recommended as store keeper at Port Phillip Bay isa giving man that I mentioned to you in London, his family are veryrespected. <br />
				{ blank lines e.g. _ _ _ _ _ mean that I could not understand the wordsfrom the original letters}<br />
				**************************<br />
				From Barbara Torley:<br />
				William was living in Putney before he was arrested. With a companion, he was charged at Kingston, Surrey, on 28 MAR 1785 on two counts, first on suspicion of theft from a shop in Putney and second, theft of five handkerchiefs, three cotton &amp; 2 silk, from the shop.  He was sentenced to 7 years transportation and sent to the hulks from Southwark gaol on 2 JUN 1786, received on the "Ceres" hulk when only 15 years old.  He was transferred to the "Justitia" hulk on 16 AUG 1786.<br />
				On 6 JAN 1787 he was sent to "Alexander" and he was described as a labourer.<br />
				He arrived at Port Jackson on 26 JAN 1788 and thus became a FIRST FLEETER. He worked as a cooper, first in the commissary's stores &amp; later at the wharf.<br />
				On 11 AUG 1788 he was accused of theft of spirits after being found drunk. At the trial Saltmarsh said that he had put water into an empty pipe of Rio Spirits on the 7th August &amp; drunk it on the 9th August.  He was found guilty &amp; sentenced to receive 50 lashes. (1)<br />
				On 6 JUN 1789 he was responsible for capturing the renegade black convict John Caesar, who had absconded and was raiding the settlement for food. ( 2)<br />
				He was accused, along with James Richards, of stealing oars from Lieutenant Ralph Clark's boat on 3 OCT 1789 and for this he received 50 lashes on the 13 OCT 1789.  (3)<br />
				His daughter Ann, by Elizabeth Holligan a FIRST FLEET Convict, was baptised on 20 DEC 1789.<br />
				In AUG 1790 he was sent to NORFOLK ISLAND per "Surprize".  He seems not to have been associated with his daughter Ann or her mother Elizabeth, who had gone there in MAR 1790.<br />
				On 1 JUL 1791 he had cleared one rod of a Sydney Town lot on which he was subsisting himself &amp; another person, possibly Mary BUTLER, a Second Fleet convict per "Lady Penrhyn".<br />
				On 31 MAR 1792 he was out of his time and working for his living with settlers.<br />
				In APR 1792 he had been detected in a theft, for which he received 100 lashes &amp; was ordered to work in a gaol gang "during pleasure" (for an indefinite period).  His confinement was short as he left Norfolk Island for BENGAL by "PITT" on 7 MAY 1792.  Lieutenant Gov. King writing of him that he was "just another scoundrel".<br />
				In early MAY 1792 William sold 1 sow to Government Stores for 2 pounds, 10 shillings and he signed that he received the money with an X.<br />
				He abandoned Mary Butler who bore him a son William on 13 AUG 1792.<br />
				Nothing more is known of William Saltmarsh since the time he left Norfolk Island per "Pitt".  It is possible that he never reached England, as he would have been very weak after receiving 100 lashes &amp; then having to face a sea voyage via INDIA to ENGLAND.  It is also believed that the "Pitt" was attacked en route to India &amp; William may have died then.<br />
