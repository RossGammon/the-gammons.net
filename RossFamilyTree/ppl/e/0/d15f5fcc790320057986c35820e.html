			<h4>Narrative</h4>
			<div class="grampsstylednote">
				<p>
				Benjamin Franklin Cutcliffe is the son of William Roderick Cutcliffe and grandson of Francis Webster Cutcliffe.  Ben Cutcliffe was born on March 24, 1907, in Duluth, Minnesota.  he is the youngest of two sons born to William and Anna Warner. <br />
				Ben's early years (six months to five years of age) were spent in Drummond, Minnesota.  <br />
				For health reasons, and because the older children in the family needed to return to Duluth for their education, Ben's mother, Anna Cutcliffe, and the older children moved back to Duluth when Ben was six months old.  Edith Jane (Mae) Cutcliffe MacLean, known to Ben as "Aunt Edie", an older sister of Ben's father, moved from Prince Edward Island, Canada to Drummond in 1907 to assume the duties of surrogate mother to Ben. <br />
				Those early years in Drummond played an important role in Ben's life. They instilled in him a sense of strength and independence that stayed with him through out his life.  Ben learned how to: handle guns, hunt and survive in the rough country that surrounded Drummond.  <br />
				Between 2 and 3 years of age, Ben befriended several Indian children whose fathers hunted to provide food for the lumber camps.  Ben was adopted into the Chippewa Nation, Rice tribe, and due to his curly blond hair was given the Indian name of "White Bird".<br />
				One of BenÕs favorite memories at this early age was that of his dog ÒQueenÓ.  Queen was on half Saint Bernard and one half Newfoundland and was BenÕs canstant companion.  Uncle Frank, (Francis Albert Cutcliffe), built a two wheel cart that Queen could be harassed to and Ben could ride in it.<br />
				Uncle Frank, who gave young Ben the nickname "Doc", also provided Ben with opportunities to perfect his public speaking abilities and, at the same time, provide entertainment for the family.  Uncle Frank would place young Ben on a table and give him a subject to speak on.  In later life, Ben found many opportunities to utilize this early training. <br />
				At the age of five, Ben moved to Duluth to join his Mother and his Brother and Sisters.  Ben's early school years were spent at Jackson School in Duluth (1912 -1921).  These years were spent much the same as any other child of that time and location. <br />
				The house Ben lived in was located on a steep incline.  Across a gravel avenue that ran along the North side of Ben's house was a field that was bordered on one side by a cliff.  This cliff was studded with lava boulders that were the residue of an ancient volcano.  These boulders were used by Ben and his friends as a fertile playground for their imaginations. <br />
				BenÕs summers were filled with the normal games of children.  In the winter, Ben and his friends spent their time skating, skiing and tobogganing.  This latter sport was unusual since the sled these children utilized was approximately 14 feet long and held as many children.  The toboggan could reach estimated speeds of 60 to 70 miles per hour as it careened down the steep streets that are common in that section of Duluth.<br />
				Ben was taught to be a very religious child.  He would regularly attend Sunday school and services at the First Presbyterian Church, then he would attend Sunday school at the neighboring Methodist Church.  Later that same day, Ben would attend a third Sunday school.  His intent, however, was slightly less honorable than his actions.  Ben attended the Methodist Sunday School because most of his Boy Scout troop attended the Methodist Church.  This gave Ben the opportunity to spend more time with his friends.  His reason for attending the third service each Sunday was because that church offered children an attendance prize.<br />
				Ben's home life consisted of reading books (a pastime he enjoyed his whole life), listening to his mother practicing her singing, listening to the Edison phonograph, playing checkers with his father or experimenting with electricity along with his older brother Wendell.<br />
				BenÕs sister's boyfriend, who was a professional football player, inspired Ben's interest in sports.  In the eighth grade Ben went out for football at Washington Junior High School (1919 - 1921).  He played the game through four years at Duluth Central High School (1921-1925).  After High School, Ben played football at both Superior State College (1925 - 1926) and the University of Minnesota (1926 - 1927).  Ben also played football for one year at the University of Hawaii.  After College, Ben went on to play two years of professional football with a team known as "Ernie Nevers Eskimos" or the "Duluth Eskimos" (one of the earlier professional football teams that included such teams as the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears).  Ben had many fond memories of his football career.  As a offensive tackle and defensive end, he had the opportunity to play with, and against, the legendary Bronco Negerski and Red Grange. <br />
				Ben's love for athletics included hockey, boxing, skiing and other sports.  He was an avid participant and remained a true believer in the benefits athletics provide. <br />
				Throughout his school years Ben earned his own spending money through many jobs.  His first job, at 10 years of age, was as a paperboy under the supervision of his older brother Wendell.  Other after school jobs included selling papers on street corners, delivering typewriters via the streetcar, and stocking office supplies.  BenÕs first full time summer job was during his eighth grade summer.  Because of his size, Ben looked older than his years.  His size allowed him to acquire a job working for the railroad as a "Hossler Helper".  The Hossler Helper filed the locomotive tenders with coal and water.  Ben also worked as a Bell Hop at the St. Louis Hotel in Duluth. <br />
				During his ninth and tenth grade summers, Ben worked on ore boats that sailed the Great Lakes.  These huge ore boats (400 to 600 feet in length) would carry iron ore to major cities along the Great Lakes and return to Duluth with coal.  On his first voyage Ben worked as a "Porter" and "Cook's Helper".  On his second voyage Ben worked as a "Coal Passer" which required him to shovel coal from the storage bins to where the "Fireman" could reach the coal and stoke the boiler.  On his third and subsequent voyages Ben worked as a "Deck Hand''.  These summer jobs provided Ben with the experience of travel and exposure to the world outside his childhood.<br />
				Ben's eleventh grade summer was spent working as a Chauffeur and Gardener.  During his twelfth grade summer Ben worked as a "Spike pitcher' on the farm of his mother's uncle.  This farm was run by James Marrow and was located near the town of Mancato in Southern Minnesota. <br />
				The summers of Ben's college years, at Superior State, were spent working as a door to door salesman for the Power and Light Company. He earned $150.00 a month selling everything from light bulbs to vacuum cleaners.  While at the University of Minnesota, Ben worked for the American Express Company loading and unloading railroad cars. <br />
				Ben became bored with college in 1927 and decided to enter the Secret Service as an undercover agent.  His assignment was to investigate the "mess accounts" of the 19th Infantry.  The 19th Infantry was located in Hawaii.  This gave Ben the opportunity to travel to Hawaii and to play football for the University of Hawaii. Ben spent about six months in Hawaii and returned to the mainland in 1928 via the Panama Canal, New York City and Boston.  <br />
				Ben's primary motivation for returning to the mainland was his desire to pursue a beautiful young lady he had been seeing prior to the time he spent with the Secret Service. <br />
				Back in Duluth, Ben worked again for the Power and Light Company as a salesman and also as a station attendant for Pure Oil.  These jobs, however, only provided a means by which Ben could be closer to his future wife. <br />
				Ben's courtship plans were interrupted as he had to move to Minneapolis in order to get employment as an Investigator and Credit Manager for the North West Money Co. <br />
				Ben recalled one incident during his tenure as a Credit Manager in which he had to collect a debt from a professional wrestler.  Upon confronting this individual and informing the wrestler that his debts were due, Ben unwillingly became involved in a fight.  Fortunately, Ben's background in both football and boxing came through for him and he was able to escape the incident relatively unscathed.  He was also successful in receiving a small, but hard earned, payment on the debt. <br />
				Ben must have made a lasting impression on Ava as he was often able to persuade her to come to Minneapolis to visit him.  In July 1929 Ben asked Ava to marry him.  He was so determined to marry Ava that he got the marriage license before he asked the question.  When Ava told him that she was not ready for marriage, Ben feelings were dashed and in anger and frustration he tore up the license in front of her.  Feeling that this lady was worth an all out effort, Ben made many more attempts to obtain Ava's hand in marriage.  Finally, Ava agreed to marry Ben and on October 19, 1929 they began over 50 years of marriage at St. Stevens Catholic Church in South Minneapolis. <br />
				Ava and Ben's first home was a one-bedroom apartment on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis.  This home proved to be a gathering place for many of the young couple's friends and family.  On weekends, during the football season, 6 to 8 friends would stay at Ben and Ava's apartment and attend games at the University of Minnesota. <br />
				Ava worked for a coffee company in Minneapolis but when Ben lost his job with the NorthWest Money Co., in 1931, the couple moved back to Duluth.  Ben bought a grocery/meat market located at 732 West Fifth Street, in Duluth, and the couple moved into an apartment above the market.  Between 1931 and 1933 Ben and Ava purchased and operated three small grocery stores and meat markets.  Ben had a dream that was original in those times.  He dreamed that someday he would be able to expand this business into a large chain of neighborhood stores.  This dream, however, became a victim of the tragic economic times known as the "Great Depression".  People not only lost their jobs but also lost all hope of finding the work they needed to support their families. The success of Ben's stores depended on the ability of people to charge their groceries during the week and pay this debt when they received their paycheck.  As fate would have it, most of these people lost their jobs. Sympathetic to their plight, Ben couldn't refuse them food for their families.  As a result, Ben's financial resources became overextended and he had to go out of business.  In the process, he and Ava lost all that they had.  Ben recalled that people who owed him money would cross the street when they saw him coming to avoid the embarrassment of looking him in the eye. <br />
				Between 1933 and 1934 Ben and Ava had to move into one of the apartments owned by Ben's Father.  To pay the gas and electric bills, Ben took on hourly work wherever and whenever he could.  Ave had to baby-sit her sister Leona's children, (John and Katherine Rossie), in order to earn money to pay for food.  Ava's brother, James, would make certain that Ben and Ava enjoyed themselves on weekends by taking them out and picking up the tab.  Jim was fortunate to keep his job during the depression. 	 <br />
				On October 3, 1934, Ben was able to obtain employment as a Statistical Clerk for the Lake States Experiment Station, US Forest Service, in Duluth. This position was the beginning of a career in government service that would last over 36 years. The position of Statistical clerk involved the recording of data gathered on the trees and surrounding soil at ten miles intervals across the United States.  Surveyors would record the number, species, height, and age of trees in addition to sampling the soil.  Ben's job was to record this data on computer punch cards.  The purpose of this work was to provide previously unrecorded data on the trees that were growing in the United States.  This data was eventually utilized in a text for forestry students and by the Civilian Conservation Corp. (C.C.C.) which planted the trees that helped stop the damage created in the "Dust Bowl" states. <br />
				In 1935, while at a party, Ben met an army captain by the name of Mahonie.  They became friends.  Captain Mahonie offered Ben a position with the War Department and, as a result, Ben and Ave set up residence in Kelly's Apartment Building located at West 33rd. Street, west of Hanipin near Lake Kalhoon, in Minneapolis. On April 1,1935 Ben assumed the position of Clerk (CAF-2) for the Civilian Conservation Corp. at Fort Snelling, Minnesota.  During the time Ben was at Fort Snelling (1935 - 1942) he assumed many rolls.<br />
				These were confusing times in the United States.  World War II was beginning and many of the officers in the C.C.C. were being called to active duty.  As an Officer was called to active duty, manpower was not available to fill vacated positions.  Since Ben was older than the acceptable draft age, he had to assume many responsibilities.  At one time during this period Ben held 12 positions at the same time.<br />
				Ben recalled many incidents in which, in order to keep the records straight, he would write a letter as the head of one department and send himself a reply as the head of another.  Approximately two years after their move to Minneapolis, Ben received word that his sister, Lilah, had become seriously ill.   Ben had to take Lilah to a clinic in Rochester Minnesota.  Ben was with his sister at her death in 1937. <br />
				Ben and Ava moved into a fourplex across the street from their apartment on 33rd street where they met the Conboys who would prove to be life long friends.  They then moved into a cottage between 35th and 36th street where they lived for two years until their first child Mary Ann (Cutcliffe) Pierce was born on August 19, 1939. <br />
				To make room for their expanded family, Ben and Ava moved back into the fourplex on 33rd street.   The Conboys immediately fell in love with Mary.  Ava would say that, because of the constant attention the Conboy's gave to the baby, Mary's "feet never touch the ground". <br />
				When the CCC was discontinued, Ben and Ava had to rent a room in a boarding house on West Lake Street.  This forced them to a put their furniture into storage until they found out where they were going to live. Fortunately, Ben was offered a job in Omaha, Nebraska that was to start in approximately six months.  During the time Ben and Ava were waiting for the new job to become available, their only son Thomas Franklin Cutcliffe was born on November 17,1942.  On the icy night Tom was born, Ben had to take the car across town to pick up Jane Conboy so that Mary could be properly cared for while Ava was giving birth to Tom.  Ben barely made it back in time and Ava barely made it to the hospital before Tom arrived. <br />
				On February 2, 1943 Ben and Ava moved to Fontinel Blvd., in Omaha, Nebraska.  Ben and Ava purchased their first house in Omaha in the Florence addition.  They paid about $6,500 for this three-bedroom house. In Omaha, Ben assumed the position of Quartermaster Agent, Purchasing-Contracting Officer, Property Officer, Salvage Officer and Building Custodian in the Discontinued Projects Branch, Adjutant Generals Office.  Because of the war, the C.C.C. and various other agencies were in the process of being liquidated.  Ben played a key roll in that process. <br />
				When the liquidation of the C.C.C. was completed, Ben was assigned to help establish the first record center.  These record centers were established to store and maintain the inactive personnel files of the War Department's separated civilian employees and the C.C.C.'s administrative records.  During the process of establishing this operation, Ben initiated the "traveling personnel folder".  This type of folder was later adopted by all government agencies. <br />
				Ben was also involved in the conversion of record keeping from the traditional alphabetical filing system to the "Soundex" system. The Soundex system established a number for each file.  This system would eventually lead to the computerization of the file locations for personnel records. Ben received many suggestion awards, and the Meritorious Service Emblem while in Omaha. The Discontinued Projects Branch was renamed The Civilian Personnel Records Branch and the function was transferred to St. Louis, Missouri along with 90,000 cu. ft. of records.  Ben was transferred to St. Louis on April 3, 1946 and promoted to Administrative Officer (CAF-10).<br />
				Ben and Ava's second daughter Patricia Elizabeth (Cutcliffe) Solomon was born on November 22, 1947.  Pat was the joy of the entire family and, is recognized as the person who helps the most in caring for the entire family. <br />
				In St. Louis, Ben was assigned as Chief, 201 Records Section.  He managed the movement and placement of records from Omaha to St. Louis.  During his five years in St. Louis, Ben reorganized three branches of the Adjutant Generals Office into one and developed and installed procedures that would combine four organizations (Retirement Records Branch, Clinical Records Branch, Pay Records Branch and Civilian Personnel Branch) into one operating branch. On April 16, 1951 Ben was transferred to the South Eastern District of the US Air Force Auditor Generals Office, located in Atlanta, Georgia. Ben assumed the position of Chief of the Management and Administrative Division at a CAF-11 level. <br />
				Ben and the family moved to Maretta Georgia and had to live in a boarding house until they found an up-stairs apartment in the nearby town of Sumerna, Georgia.  One of the unfortunate envents that occurred to the family in Sumerna was teh realization that prejudice against both Northerners and Catholics was still very strong in that part of the country.  Only while the family was moving out of Sumeran, back to St. Louis, did the family find out that this seemly peaceful town harbored the headquarters for the KKK in Georgia.<br />
				On July 17, 1951 Ben was offered and accepted a position with the General Services Administration (GSA) as an Administrative Officer (GS-12) in St. Louis.<br />
				The family moved back to St. Louis and again faced a housing shartage and had to reside with relatives, (Bill and Peggy Swift) for a couple of months.  Ben and Ava then moved into an apartment located above a loca tavern until the house they purchased on Rockhill Road in Webster Groves, Missouri, became available.  The CutcliffeÕs lived in Webster Groves for approximately 4 years.<br />
				As Administrative officer Ben assumed responsibility for over 258 employees and 145,529 cu. ft. of Department of Defense civilian personnel and pay records.  Within 12 months, Ben became responsible for the same type of records from over 160 different federal agencies bringing the total holdings to over 300,000 cu. ft.  This expansion was accomplished without increasing personnel, experiencing any turnover of personnel or accumulating operational backlogs.  Increased man-year production standards, more efficient procedures and the establishment of a high "esprit de core" accounted for this accomplishment. On January 24, 1955 Ben was promoted to the position of NARS (National Archives and Records Service) Deputy Regional Director, 6th Region of GSA (GS-14). <br />
				With the promotion Ben and his family moved to Kansas City, Kansas. They lived for a short time in Mission, Kansas before purchasing a house on Mission Drive in Roland Park, Kansas were they lived for nearly 10 years. <br />
				During this time, Ben and Ava's two older children attended St. Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kansas.  With only Pat living at home, and soon to go to college herself, Ben and Ava in 1963 inherited a second family.  Do to the untimely deaths of both Ava's brother James and his wife Serrie, Ben and Ava assumed responsibility for raising three orphaned children (Marine, Kevin and Mary Margaret Stapleton). <br />
				In his new position as Deputy Regional Director, Ben proceeded to implement the records management procedures and methods he had developed and learned in his career to date.  Steps were taken to bring personnel to a high standard of performance and a well-rounded program in records management was put into practice throughout his region. These actions resulted in millions of dollars of savings per year. In 1960, Ben was promoted to a grade of GS-15.  Along with his other duties, Ben acted as direct advisor to the Archivist of the United States and the liaison between the Department of Defense and NARS in the planning and implementing of a national takeover of all military personnel records.  The implementation of this takeover required increases in the efficiency and productivity of the personnel who were transferred into Ben's organization.  Under Ben's direction, the time it took the military to respond to inquiries was reduced from 2 - 4 weeks to 3 days. <br />
				During his tenure as Regional Director, 6th Region, Ben's organization assumed additional responsibility for over 3,000,000 cu. ft. of records while reducing the number of employees needed to service those records from 1,400 to 728.  He also managed the planning and construction of the first building specifically designed as a Federal Records Center. <br />
				Ben has stated that he derived his greatest satisfaction out of training and developing people who later, used what they learned, to become successful administrators in government and industry.  Secondly, Ben stated that he enjoyed the opportunity of directing those functions that dramatically reduced the cost of operations.	<br />
				In 1968, Ava's health was deteriorating and Ben requested a transfer to California.  In appreciation for his contributions while in the service of the government, Ben was transferred to the West Coast as the Manager of the Federal Records Center located in Bell, California. Ben, Ava, Pat and Marine, Kevin and Mary Margaret Stapleton lived in Whittier, California until after Ben's Retirement in 1970.  At his retirement, Ben had completed 36 years of government service. <br />
				Upon retirement, Ben and Ava moved to El Cojon for approximately 3 years and later moved to Downey, California. Until Ava's death on November 19, 1986, Ben's retirement years were occupied with the care of his wife.  Although he would deny it, Ben has set an example as a husband and a father.  His love and devotion to his wife and family cannot be equaled.  Even his numerous career achievements pale in comparison to the quality of his life and the example he has given to his family. <br />
				On June 2,1989, Ben married a second time to Mary Jane (Smith) Mooney. Ben and Mary Jane resided in Santa Margaretta California. Benjamin Franklin Cutcliffe passed away in Santa Margarita, California on September 7, 1998 at the age of 91.  His Funeral Service was held on September 11, 1998 at San Francisco Solano Catholic Church in Santa Margarita, California.  He was buried next to his wife, Ava, in All Souls Cemetery in Long Beach, California on September 12, 1998.<br />
				Eulogy of Benjamin Franklin Cutcliffe delivered by his son: <br />
				ÒJust after Sunday Mass, a little 12 year old boy was wandering around the Church while his parents talked with other grown-ups.  An elderly gentleman approached the little boy and began to speak with him in a voice of such gentle strength that the child could do nothing but stop and listen.  He was immediately struck by the sparkle and clarity in the old manÕs eyes, the warmth of his voice, and the kindness in his disposition.  The youth was riveted and felt a warm comfort in the gentlemanÕs ancient face.  When the boyÕs parents gathered him up for the ride home, the little boy reluctantly left the side of the old man.<br />
				The boyÕs parents were amazed by the reaction the boy had to this old  stranger.  The child simply could not stop talking about how impressive the old man was.  Once the family pulled into the driveway of their home the little boy claimed proudly, "When I get to be THAT old, I wanna look just like him!"<br />
				The father knew that, what his son had seen, was more than just a charming wrinkled brow.  His perceptive son had seen clarity of conscience in the manÕs eyes, heard warmth of heart in his voice, and, in his smile, plainly saw the goodness the old man had worked toward throughout his life.  These attributes did not come to the old man through magic or genetics, but had come to him because he had lived a long life filled with love and kindness.  The boyÕs father finaly answered his son, "If you want to look like that elderly gentleman, you had better start now."<br />
				Like the old man in the story, Dad began developing his many and varied attributes when he was a little boy.  He worked for over 91 years to be the best man he could be.  Today, we celebrate his achievements and we thank him for his gifts to us as a husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather. We remember him as a man who helped shape our lives; both past and future.  We are, and always will be, a part of him and he will always be a part of us.<br />
				IÕve struggled with what to say today, my mind automatically generating thoughts, not only of the major events and accomplishments in DadÕs life, of which there are many, but of the small yet meaningful incidents.  I believe that if we weave both the major and the minor events together, we will discover a clearer picture of a man we love and a man who loves us.<br />
				Dad took pride in his career accomplishments.  As a young man, he dreamed of owning a chain of grocery stores.  He purchased three small Mom and Pop stores with plans for a great future for himself and his family.  Fate, however, had different plans.  When the Great Depression hit, most families lost the financial ability to pay for much needed food.  Nevertheless, Dad continued to let customers purchase food on credit knowing all too well that he would never<br />
				see it repaid.  He simply could not turn them down.  Eventually he lost all he had.<br />
				Several years later he started his 30 year career with the government.  His accomplishments were many and impressive.  He helped plan and open the Eisenhower and Truman Presidential Libraries.  He carried the Japanese surrender documents from Washington DC for placement in one of those libraries.<br />
				Dad took pride in helping men returning from World War II and the Korean War by giving them hope for a new life with the help of a good job.<br />
				He received many awards for increasing efficiency and reducing costs; a rare occurance in government circles.<br />
				Dad loved many sports and was an incredibly gifted athlete.  Football,<br />
				however, was his favorite.  In his youth he played for three colleges and went on to play 2 years of professional football with Ernie NeaverÕs "Eskimos" based in Duluth Minnesota.  I have many fond memories of going to and watching football games with my father.  So passionate was his love of the game and of me, that he and my mother would travel several hundred miles to watch me play.<br />
				Dad was a gadget lover.  We would ask him what he wanted for his birthday or Christmas and he would always say "Just get me a gadget".  He ended up with a lot of gadgets.<br />
				Dad loved ice cream.  Dad loved LOTS of ice cream.  He would take a gallon of ice cream out of itÕs container and cut it in 5 equal pieces for the five members of the family.  To this day I still love ice cream.  In fact, I love LOTS of ice cream.<br />
				Dad was known in the family for preparing a great breakfast.<br />
				Although he did not become an official Catholic until just a few years ago, we liked to jest that he was the best Catholic in the family because he always made certain that we all got ready for Mass on time, he drove us there, and patiently waited outside until Mass was over.<br />
				Dad made Christmas a special time.  When we were young, he would go to great lengths to help us believe in Santa Claus.  He made foot prints leading out of the fireplace and put sled marks in the snow on the roof of our house.  One Christmas eve, he slept on the couch near the fireplace because Mary, his oldest daughter, was afraid of Santa coming down the chimney.<br />
				For several years, on April Fools day, the kids would replace the white part of Oreo cookies with soap and offer the cookies to Dad when he came home from work.  To our amazement, each year he would eat the cookies and exclaim, with delight, how good they tasted.<br />
				Dad was a student of the Civil War.  He loved to read, especially about the war, and often fascinated me, my sons, and others with his broad knowledge of that tragic event.<br />
				Dad loved working around the house.  Once we had our own homes, he spent many hours helping all of us with major remodeling projects of our own.<br />
				Dad was always there for the kids.  If it was important to us, it was important to him.  He very rarely missed one of those important events.<br />
				During motherÕs long illness, father cared for her; unfaltering and lovingly. We all knew that, if it were possible, he would gladly have sacrificed his own life to save hers.<br />
				Dad had a way of making children feel safe and secure.  My son, Brad, told me that he always felt a tangible sense of security when he came into my FatherÕs house.  That secure feeling came from the silent love that filled his homes. He did not have to tell you he loved you, you just knew it.<br />
				Like the little 12 year old who wanted to be like the old man, I wanted to be like my Father.  When I am asked about the greatest influence in my life, I speak his name without hesitation.  If I were forced to give him a title, it would be "My Hero".<br />
				My Mother always told me that if I could grow up to be half the man my Father was she would be very proud of me.  I am still working on that goal and I pray that when I look into my MotherÕs eyes again I can tell her that I achieved the goal she set for me.<br />
				We love you Dad and we will miss you very much.Ó
