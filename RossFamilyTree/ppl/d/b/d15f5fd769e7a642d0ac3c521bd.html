			<h4>Narrative</h4>
			<div class="grampsstylednote">
				<p>
				Charles Cutcliffe of Bidford and subsequently of Weach, parish of Westleigh, eldest son, Attorney-at-Law, named in the will of his brother John, adm. to his son Thomas, succeeded to the estates on the death of his nephew Robert Cutcliffe, s.p. 1745, under a settlement made 1729, d. 30 August. Will 20 July, pro. 4 Oct. 1745, P.C.C..  In 1745 Charles devised the manor of Witheridge and his estate there to his second son the Reverend John Cutcliffe.<br />
				"Charles of Brideford, and subsequently of Weach, in the parish of Westleigh (Which latter property was devised to him by his halfbrother...Challacombe), and who ultimately succeeded to the Ilfracombe estates."<br />
				" Charles Cutcliffe of Weach, in the parish of Westleigh, and Bideford, co. Devon, the eldest son of John Cutcliffe of Damage, by Grace Newell, his second wife, was baptized at Ilfracombe, 30th January 1683.  In 1707 (July 6), he was married at Great Torrington to Avice Nash of Iddersleigh or Ingersleigh, by whom he had a large family.  Mr. Charles Cutcliffe was a Solicitor, and resided at Bideford.  I have in my possession a large number of the letters which, during the years 1727-35, he wrote to his son Charles, who was then in London studying for his father's profession. <br />
				They are, in the main, business letters interspersed, however, with family news and amusing county chit-chat.  Judging from their contents, Mr. Cutcliffe was an acute man of business, with very prudent views as to the duties of man to man." NeverÓ writes he tohis son, Òbe a judge between friends if you can help it, for you are sure to gett an Òenemy by your determination, be it never so just.Ó His paternal advise (very usually accompanied by apposite quotations from or references to the classics, of which especially Horace, he was evidently very fond) indicates sound moral principles, and is dictated by much gentlemanlike feeling.<br />
				In one of his letters, written in March 1727 he gives very precise instructions to his son (who had then recently left home) as to the improvement of his leisure hours and the conduct of his studies, adding that Òwithout method nothing considerable if to be doneÓ.  he recommends especially a perusal of ChiceroÕs Offices, and urges that specially heed be taken of Òthe choice of your company, and as it has been well observed that every painter in some measure paints himself so Ôtis true that every man is like the company he keeps, and as it is impossible for a person to be often in vicious company and not be tainted with their views, as Ôtis to be often in the company of good men and not charmed with their virtues.Ó<br />
				At the same time Mr Cutcliffe was not an advocate of Òall work and no playÓ.  He rejoices that his son has been to the play, when the King and Queen were present, and dilates upon the advantages to be derived from a well acted play.<br />
				Nor does the worthy writer appear to have been altogether above the pleasures of the table. In January 1728 he writes that he had kept a very merry Christmas; but that, through the irregularities of his neighbour, Mr. Down, he had Ògott a pain in his left footÓ, and that the gout had seized him, philosophically adding, ÒI give as little way to the distemper as possible, my outward remedy being ÔflannelÕ, inwardly, patience and port.Ó which he hopes will sett him a walking in a few days more, for Òthey agree well with the distemper.... This touch will, I hope, guard me against irregularity for the future, and the dread of it be very useful.  If you have it not till my age, youÕll have no great reason to complain; thoÕ the pain is acute, it takes not off the appetite, and is a great promoter of consider Ôcon.Ó  Neither does he confine his opinion of the benefit of generous living to himself; for he urges on his son not on any account to allow his spirits to flag, but to support them Òwith a glass of wine now and then.Ó<br />
				The following relate to bits of country news:..Ó May 21, 1728.  There was a very great storm at Pill last Friday, I mean within doors, for that morning ab one, the parson of Tawton and Mad Chichester ridd away togeather without a serv in order to be married; but where the jobb was done I donÕt yer hear whith certainty.  The parson yesterday made a visit in his coach, and no doubt looks very grand.Ó<br />
				ÒJune 9, 1728.  I think I wrote you that the Viccar of Tawton had married Mad Chichester.  I must now acquaint you, that Coz Moll Chichester was married to Mr. Waldron, her old sweetheart, the Monday following, but not discovered till last week.  I had the pleasure yesterday of bringing father and daughter together at Pill, where all things were perfectly reconciled, and am forthwith to prepare an hadsome settlement.Ó<br />
				ÒOct. 8, 1728.  Last Sunday senÕnight the Duke de Ripperda (who lately escaped out of the Castle of Segovia) was putt on Wollacombe sands, out of an Irish barque; he had no one with him but the lady who procured his deliverance, the corporal of the guard and one servant.  He was handsomely treated at Mr. HarrisÕs, and last Tuesday went on to Exon.Ó<br />
				October 29, 1728.  Last Saturday senÕnight Mrs. Anne Rolle was married to Mr. Thomas Staford with her uncleÕs consent, who also gavehe a fortune.Ó<br />
				ÒApril 5, 1730. Your old master (Rev. Dr. Z. Mudge) is pitched on by the Archdeacon himselfe to preach before the Clergy tomorrow fortnight and I hope it will be an introduction to his preferment, for Ôtis impossible that man of learning can know him and neglect him.Ó  The sermon on the Reverend Doctor was a success, as is triumphantly narrated in a further letter.<br />
				ÒMay 10, 1730. Mr. Rolle, of Stevenstone, died of apoplexy last Wednesday morning.  He was a gentleman of great charity and generosity,Ó&amp;c.<br />
				Ò15th May, 1731.  Last Sunday morning died Sir Nicholas Hooper, full of days.  How he has disposed of his substance I know no; but I believe it must be great.  He is a great example of the effects of industry; ÔDii laboribus omnia venduntÕ is very true.<br />
				Ò21st May, 1732.  Last Thursday Mad Bassett, a lady much admired for her piety, prudence, and good conduct, was married at South Molton to one Mr. Morrison of New College Oxon, her sonÕs tutor.  ThoÕ a lady of her complexion could not resist nature, she had however taken care that her marriage shall be agreeable to her son as well as herself; for she has surrendered the barton and seat of Heanton Court and, as I am well informed, has obliged herself to quitt all her jointure if ever her fatherÕs estate fall to her, as it must on the death of her brother without issue.Ó <br />
				"Mr. Cutcliffe was the intimate friend of Dr. Reynolds (with whom he was connected through the Rowe family) and his adviser as to the future destiny of his celebated son Sir Joshua.  I have in my possission some letters written between 1740 and 1743, from the Doctor to Mr. Cutcliffe, the main interest in which is the reference to his son Joshua. But as they have to that extent been printed in full in Leslie's "Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds", I do not think it worth while to reprint them here.  Writing from Plympton in March 1740, to Mr. Cutcliffe, the Doctor desires his advice and judgement whether his whould be bound to an apothecary or to a painter.  Joshua, sent by his father in October 1740 to Bideford, is the bearer of a letter to Mr. Cutcliffe, "to wait on you and to obey orders".  In 1740 (Oct. 26) Dr. Reynolds writes that, "Joshua arrived in London with your son on Saturday, Oct. 13, "when he went to be bound apprentice to Thomas Hudson, a native of Devonshire, and at that time the principal portrait painter in England. <br />
				In 1743 (19th August) Dr.  Reynolds wrote to Mr. Cutcliffe, ÒAs to Joshua's affairÓ, (that was, his dismissal by Hudson form his employment), Òhe will give you a full account of it when he waits upon you, as he designs to do, (he shall lay open the whole matter to you as a father, as I know he may), and will be glad to present you with your picture, who have been so good a benefactore to him.Ó  ÒI do not knowÓ (continues the doctor), Òany painter who is capable of doing you justice (I don't speak out of compliment) for a painter must have sharp eyes to see one half of that which is in you; but I believe Mr. Mudge, who has seen Joshua's performances will agree with me that he is likely to do you justice, if any painter can.Ó  Of the proposed portrait my aunt had no knowledge, so that probably it was never painted.  There is, however, a small oval crayon drawing existing, reputed to be the likeness of Mr. Cutcliffe, but its merits as a work of art are small:  it may however be a sketch by Sir Joshua.<br />
				On family matters Mr. Cutcliffe writes to his son under date 17 November 1728, ÒYour aunt Cutcliffe of DamageÓ (Margaret Burgoyne)Ódied last week, and fell like ripe fruit in its season.  The old hero (John Cutcliffe, her husband) is pretty well, but his spirits seem to flag, and I doubt he will not long survive.Ó  Again on 11th. May, 1729 - ÒI was at Damage last Thirsday, where I found your Uncle Cutcliffe in a declining state; steel and marble must submitt.  But Coz Rob and Frank are fond of having the estate transmitted to persons of the family worthy of reviving it.Ó  And his letter of 8th July, 1729, conveys the intellignece of the death of old John Cutcliffe of Damage: - ÒLast friday, your uncle Cutcliffe sent me word that he was so well, that he intended to meet me at Barum next friday to new make his will which he had neglected to doe ever since Cousin AnneÕs marriage; but so uncertain are business affairs  that Saturday about noon a messenger brought me word he was found in his bed speechless that morning, he was blooded and blisterÕd, but in vain for abÕ twelve at night he died.Ó<br />
				ÒHis daughter Anne is a considerable gainer by his sudden death.  I hope there will be no difference between the brothers and sisters but what I can reconcile, thoÕ God knows they are of very jarring tempers.  YouÕl have the pleasure when you come down to find the death of your uncle has made room for a relacon who has, if I mistake not, a greater concern for the real good of my family than his father.Ó  On the 3rd February, 1729, he writes of this relation as follows:  Ò Last Friday morning Cousin Robert put his generous resolucons towards me into practice, for were before prepared by his direcons and has thereby in case of failure of issue male in him and his brother, absolutely conveyed to me and my heires the revercon in fee of all his lands:  so that Ôtis not altogether improbably but some of my posterity may possess the seat of their ancestors, and I hope to be an honour to the family, and perpetuate to posterity that virtue and love of truth which was so conspicuous in the old JohÕes de Rupescissa that it gave him a place among the martyrs.Ó<br />
				In 1745 Mr. Charles Cutcliffe intered into possission of the family estates. A letter, written by him to his son William who was then at Exeter College, Oxford, dated 4th June in that year, gives an account of it:- ÒBideford, June 4th, 1745.  Cousin Robert was buried this day senÕnight.  Your brothers attended the furerall, and the day following being the restoracon day, I went there and took possession, and had all the title deeds and conuterparts of leases delivered up in a friendly manner.  The widow has agreed to stay till Micha, but then I doubt I must gett a tenant for the Barton, your brother Charles being determined not to go there at present.  Last Wednesday and Thursday wee killed three brace of hares, and Wednesday were entertained witha most agreeable sight; no less than five large French prizes were that day conducted close under the Hoe up Bristol Channell by two stout privateers, one belonging to Bristoll, thÕ other to Dartmouth, they engaged no less than six at once, sunk the Comadore, and took the other five; this was a glorious exploit.Ó<br />
				Mr. Cutcliffe did not long enjoy the estates to which he had succeeded; he died 30th August 1745, aged 62, having made his will, dated the 20th July preceding, whereby he settled the Barton of Damage and Manors of Lyncombe and Warcombe, and all his other lands, &amp;c, in the parish of Ilfracombe, on his son Charles Cutcliffe for life, with remainder to his sonÕs issue male, with remainder to his (testatorÕs) other sons and their issue in tail male.  <br />
				As of the year 2000, the portrait of Charles Cutcliffe, mentioned above, is in the possession of a museum located in Exeter, England.
