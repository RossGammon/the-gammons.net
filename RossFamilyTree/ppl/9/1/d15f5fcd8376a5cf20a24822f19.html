			<h4>Narrative</h4>
			<div class="grampsstylednote">
				<p>
				TODD MATHES CUTCLIFFE October 15, 1965 - March 30, 1985<br />
				This biography will be the very difficult to write.  A parent who has lost a child is incapable of looking at that child's life objectively.  I, therefore, apologize to the reader in advance if what follows is a parent's reflections rather than an exact history. <br />
				Todd Mathes Cutcliffe was born at on October 15, 1965  at the United States Marine Corp (USMC) base hospital in Barstow, California.  It was not an easy birth for either the child or the mother. Todd was the first son of Thomas F. Cutcliffe and Sondra J. (Holman) Cutcliffe and the older brother, by a little over six years to Brad Holman Cutcliffe. <br />
				Todd was an interesting and an unusual child from the very beginning. He was fortunate enough to be born during the lifetime of his Great Grandfather, Lloyd Mathes and his middle name reflects the respect and admiration the family had for Sondra's Grandfather.  Lloyd Mathes and his daughter, Thelma (Mathes) Holman, drove from Western Kansas to Barstow, California to help care for, and welcome into this world, the first Great Grandchild of the Mathes family and the first Grandchild of the Holman family. <br />
				As with most children, who are the first born of a young married couple, Todd changed his parents lives in many ways.  Todd was an easy baby to raise, although his parents soon realized that Todd did not like to take naps.  He was a loving child and reflected the love his parents had for each other and their son. <br />
				Several months after his birth, Todd moved with his parents to Oceanside, California where he learned to walk, said his first words and managed to put everything he could lift into his mouth.  <br />
				Todd also learned to love water during his swimming lessons at the early age of one year. At almost two years of age, Todd's parents moved to Albany, California and Todd became exposed to the many nationalities of people that lived in student housing at the University of California at Berkeley.  As the child of a graduate student, Todd had to adjust to his father's study schedule and a Mother who had to work in order to keep the family fed. <br />
				At Four years of age, Todd and his parents moved to Dayton, Ohio. Todd's biggest adjustments, while in Dayton, was his introduction to school and the arrival of his little brother, Brad Holman Cutcliffe in December of 1971.  The adjustment to the arrival of his little brother was welcomed by Todd and he enjoyed Brad almost as much as his parents did.  Over the years Todd and Brad's relationship was more than a normal brotherly relationship.  As children they fought like most brothers, but there was something special about the way they related to one another. <br />
				Todd's adjustment to school was another matter.  Although Todd was a well behaved child, he did not learn as quickly as some other children.  In 1972, after he and his family had moved to Seattle Washington, Todd was diagnosed as having a learning disability.  This disability, although not severe, forced him to work extra hard during his school years.  With the help and patients of his Mother, Todd learned to accepted the hard work and was able to achieve above average grades. <br />
				A few years after the family and moved to Palos Verdes California in 1975, Todd found his true love, the Theater.  Todd had an extraordinary talent in designing lighting and scenery for the live theater.  He spent all of his extra time working in the theater at Rolling Hills High School and at the Norris Community theater.  He received a great deal of personal satisfaction and reward for his part in 50 productions during his High School years .  These productions included:<br />
				Babes in Arms,  Call Me Madam,  Born Yesterday, The Glass Menagerie, Pajama Game,       <br />
				The Man Who Came to Dinner,  Kiss and Tell , Watch on the Rhine, A View From The Bridge.<br />
				Todd worked with many groups including:<br />
				Television productions for C.U.T.,  Palos Verdes Children's Theater, South Bay Ballet Conservatory,  Palos Verdes Players,  City of Torrance Children's Theater, Vista Grande Fund Raisers,  Long Beach Civic Light Opera, International Children's Music, Peninsula Civic Ballet Festival.<br />
				Todd completed his high school days in June, 1984.  He went on to College at Dodge City Community College were he had decided to study Electrical Engineering.  Although we will never know how his choice turned out, we believe that he would have succeed at anything he put his heart into. <br />
				Near the end of his 19 years, Todd was fortunate to establish an loving adult relationship with his grandparents Dr. William J. and Thelma O. Holman.  He was enjoying his college life and upon his passing, his friends in high school and college honored him and told of many incidences relating to his talents and his contributions to their lives.<br />
				A plaque was erected in his honor in the theater at Rolling Hills High School and a scholarship was estabilishe in ToddÕs name for individuals who display talent in the technical side of theater. <br />
				Todd, besides being an extraordinarily talented individual was, most of all, a good person.  He  gave his talent and his time to his family and his friends.  He loved his family and that love was shared.   His presence is missed and the world is not as complete, nor life as full, without him.
