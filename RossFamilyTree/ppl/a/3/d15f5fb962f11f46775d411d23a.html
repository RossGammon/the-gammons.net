			<h4>Narrative</h4>
			<div class="grampsstylednote">
				<p>
				NATHANIEL LUCAS 1764-1818<br />
				Nathaniel Lucas was born in Kingston, Surrey, England, about 1764. His father was William John Lucas, a builder of Thames Ditton, Surrey, his mother was Mary nee Bradford.<br />
				Nothing is known of Nathaniel's early life, except that he followed in his father's footsteps, taking up the trade of Carpenter and Joiner, and later becoming a builder.<br />
				His story commences when he is twenty years of age. At this time he was living in a public house in Red Lion Street, Holburn, London. On Wednesday 7th July 1784, Nathaniel was tried before Mr. Rose at Justice hall in the Old Bailey and convicted of feloniously stealing clothing, the value of which was Ð 2-0-0 ($ 4-00). This being the property of his neighbour Mary Davis, a spinster.<br />
				Sentenced to transportation for seven years, Nathaniel was to spend some time in a prison hulk anchored in the Thames. On the 13th of May 1787 he left Portsmouth aboard the "Scarborough" one of the transport ships of the First Fleet, bound for Botany Bay, New South Wales. Aboard another ship in the fleet the "Lady Penryhn" was Olivia Gascoigne, who was destined to become Nathaniel's wife.<br />
				NORFOLK ISLAND:<br />
				Nathaniel Lucas and Olivia Gascoigne, were among the 23 settlers, 7 freemen and 15 convicts specially selected by Phillip for their good character and their vocation to go to Norfolk Island. Along with a detachment of marines, under the command of Lieutenant Phillip Gidley King, they were to help set up this pioneer settlement, that was later to become so infamous in Australia's early history. This small party sailed from Sydney Cove on 15th February 1788 aboard the "Supply", with enough supplies to last six months. They arrived off Norfolk Island on 29th February, but owing to bad weather they could not get ashore. On the 2nd of March, King was able to get ashore, but it was another five days before a place could be found to safely land the main party, and transport the provisions ashore.<br />
				In 1791 Nathaniel received a grant of fifteen acres of land, which he farmed with the help of William Walsh, a convict assigned to Nathaniel, who by this time had served his sentence and was an emancipist farmer.<br />
				An entry in the "Journal of Lieutenant Governor King", dated 15th August 1792 gives a sad account of the tragedy, which claimed the lives of Nathaniel's twin daughters, Sarah and Mary and almost killed his wife Olivia.<br />
				" The carpenter Nathaniel Lucas, incautiously set fire to two pine trees which he thought would fall clear of his dwelling house, one of them unfortunately fell on it and killed two fine twin children, two years old, bruised the mother in many parts of her body and broke her arm in two places. An infant child that was in her arms at the time providently escaped unhurt, although the house was dashed to pieces.<br />
				In 1793 Nathaniel purchased a further sixty acres from Charles Heritage a former marine. Apparently Nathaniel was quite a successful farmer, for in August 1802 he sold wheat, maize and pork worth Ð450- 0-0 ($225-00) to the Government stores.<br />
				In 1795, Nathaniel constructed an overshot water-mill on Norfolk Island for a fee of three ewe sheep, the mill having a capacity to grind and dress eighteen bushels of flour a day.<br />
				On 11th June 1795 Nathaniel was appointed master carpenter succeeding William Peate. He was suspended on 5th September 1800, and reappointed 13th March 1802 and held this position until the settlement was reduced in 1805. During this time on Norfolk Island, eleven of their thirteen children were born, and two were killed tragically when at tree fell on them.<br />
				Also whilst on Norfolk Island Nathaniel was to write the following letter to his father. He gave the letter to Governor King to deliver on his return to England.<br />
				Sydney, Norfolk Island<br />
				New South Wales<br />
				20th October 1796<br />
				Dear father,<br />
				After so long an absence, an account of my state of health and situation, will no doubt be pleasing to you, and I have the pleasing satisfaction to acquaint you that me and my family are all in perfect good health and thank God and my own industry very comfortably situated my family at this present time consists of my wife and 4 children, 2 boys and 2 girls. - I had the unspeakable misfortune to lose 2 twins, girls, by an accident, which, could it be represented in a proper manner would awaken, the most tender feelings and melt the hardest heart in sympathy. It was by the fall of a pine tree which stood near my house, which buried my lovely infants in the ruins, and almost my worthy partner, who nearly escaped with her life, for she was dragged out in a situation in which her life was despaired of, O' Father I am not able to express the poignant grief I felt on this very shocking scene, without dwelling long upon this displeasing subject together with a variety of misfortunes, liable to those who transgress the laws of their country. I can now with truth assert that I have surmounted them all, and with the blessing of God I hope in the course of 2 years to return to my native country with a competency for life.<br />
				I am Master carpenter of this island for which I have a salary of Ð50-0-0 per annum. I have 2 freeholds consisting of 75 acres of land. I should be worthy very much to gratitude if I did not acquaint you that my present good fortune is to be imputed in a great measure to the humane (Governor?) and assiduous respect of Lieut. Gov. King who has even promoted my interest since my residence on this island. Perhaps it will not be unentertaining to give you some account of this island, which I believe to be one of the most fertile in the world, it produces two crops in the year one of wheat, and another of Indian corn, the crop of wheat is rather precarious on account of the variableness of the climate. Potatoes and Vegetables of all kinds are produced here in great abundance, and will grow in any month of the year provided there is a little rain when planted.<br />
				The wheat harvest generally starts about December, which is for the most part excessive hot, often accompanied with thunderstorms. The Indian corn is generally planted in June and January.<br />
				This island produces several kinds of fruit i.e.:- Watermelons, Bananas a rich and luscious berry called tomatoes or Gooseberrys, a native cone, which grows upon vines, Grapes, Figs, Apples, Lemons, and various other kinds of fruits coming to great perfection. Fish of an excellent quality are plentiful on this coast, hogs are had here in great quantities, Poultry with quantity of sheep and goats.<br />
				I had the honour under the direction of Lieut. Gov. King to construct a Water Mill for the Government, and a Wind mill on my own estate.<br />
				I have permission from His Honour Lieut. Gov. King for you and any of my friends to wait upon him who will afford any necessary assistance you may require these persons for. Do not fail in embracing the first opportunity in writing to me  nor to all friends and. Farewell and may God Almighty bless you.<br />
				From<br />
				D(ea)r Father<br />
				Your affectionate son<br />
				Nathl. Lucas<br />
				P.S.<br />
				Remember me to my brothers and sisters and all inquiring friends and anyone of my relations may wait upon Gov. King, who will acquaint you particularly of my situation.<br />
				This letter was taken to England by Lieut. Governor King, but never delivered as he appears to have been unable to locate Nathaniel's father. It is now in the Mitchell Library, Sydney.<br />
				In April 1804 Nathaniel returned with his family to Sydney aboard the "Investigator". The ship carried materials for a Government windmill, which Nathaniel was instructed to erect for the Government on a site on Church Hill. This site was approximately where the toll gates for the Sydney Harbour bridge now stand. He was also permitted to carry material for another windmill for himself, which on completion of the Government mill he was given permission to erect in the Government Domain, the site of his mill was where the Shakespeare Memorial stands near the State Library of New South Wales.<br />
				These two windmills were of the unusual post type, which had never been built in the colony before. The upper section, holding the propellers rotated on a post with their direction being determined by sails positioned like rudders. The mill stones were made on Norfolk Island, as they were more durable than the ones produced in Sydney. This mill was capable of grinding six bushels an hour.<br />
				In 1805, the Colony's Superintendent of Carpenters died and Nathaniel was appointed to the position, he was to hold this position for a short time. After this appointment the Lucas family lived in Sydney Town, having a house next door to John Macarthur. (Now 1 York Street). As well as carrying out his duties as Superintendent of Carpenters, Nathaniel and his sons operated the "Government mill" and for some time leased his mill in the Domain to Henry Kable, at this time the mill was known as "Kable's Post Mill"<br />
				Nathaniel also became a private builder, and as the colony was growing very fast by this time he was kept quite busy. In 1808, after the "Rum Rebellion" against William Bligh, in which Nathaniel took part (he was one of the 160 who signed the petition for Governor Bligh's arrest), Nathaniel was again appointed Superintendent of Carpenters at a salary of Ð50-0-0 per annum, with the extra privileges of victualling from the Government stores and being able to use assigned servants (convicts).<br />
				He apparently did so well in this position, that in 1813 he was appointed superintendent of the Government lumberyard, having sixty-one men under his control. The next year, when Governor Macquarie published Bathurst's order abolishing the privileges attached to this and many other offices, Nathaniel along with many others petitioned the Governor for them to be restored. The petition was successful, as Macquarie suspended the order.<br />
				It was about this time that Nathaniel started to give more attention to his private and public building contracts. He had already been associated with the building of the "Rum Hospital", part of which is the New South Wales State Parliament.<br />
				In 1816 he built the parsonage at Liverpool, he was also associated with the building of the one at Parramatta (both now unfortunately demolished).<br />
				In 1818 he was successful in his bid for the contract for the building of St.Luke's Church at Liverpool. left) The convict architect Francis Greenway designed the Church. Both Nathaniel and Francis Greenway were present when Governor Macquarie laid the foundation stone on 7th April 1818.<br />
				Greenway, who had quarrelled with Nathaniel over the Hospital, also quarrelled with him about the foundations of the Church, alleging that Nathaniel was addicted to the bottle, and that he was using inferior quality stone in the Church.<br />
				On 5th May 1818 Nathaniel's body was found in the mud of the river at Liverpool, his death was said, to have proceeded from his own act owing to mental derangement. <br />
				There seems to be great debate, as to the truth of this matter, it is said Nathaniel had cancer of the mouth, and used alcohol as an analgesic, it is also strange that Olivia, was convinced he had been murdered and also no record of inquest has been found for Nathaniel.<br />
				Nathaniel Lucas contributed twenty years of his life to Australian building, but none of his work remains with the exception of a portion of the Rum Hospital.<br />
				Nathaniel's sons built a number of windmills elsewhere in the colony, as well as numerous other timber buildings.<br />
				At Harris creek, near Liverpool, John Lucas built his first watermill in 1822. The capacity of this mill was said to up to one thousand bushels a week. Additional water for this mill was supplied from a reservoir constructed close to the mill, approximately 150 acres in area. John also built a mill at Woronora in 1825, at the head of the tidal waters, this mill could also grind one thousand bushels a week. Today's Lucas Heights is named after John and his mill.<br />

				Trial: Mary Davis sworn.<br />
				Trial: I am a single woman, I live in Red Lion Street, Holborn, with my father; on Tuesday last I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, from my fathers house, I went out about five in the evening, I went to the drawer in the garret for an apron, and the drawer was full as usual, the casement left open by neglect, when I returned about eleven I went to put the same apron back, and the draw was forced open, and all the things gone, they were all in this drawer but the cotton apron, and old towel, I am sure I left it locked.<br />
				Trial:  Court.<br />
				Trial: Can you speak with precision to these identical things?- I am sure I missed them all, as soon as I found I was robbed my father went the next door, and I immediately recollected the things I had lost, and that recollection I now speak (the things produced and deposed to) all the handkerchiefs are marked except one that is worked by my sister, I am sure it is mine, and this shawl my sister worked, the cotton apron I marked, and one of the muslin ones, the others are worked ones. I know them particularly, the towel is not marked, I cannot speak so positively to that as the rest, I know nothing of the prisoner.<br />
				Trial:  John Davis sworn.<br />
				Trial: I am a painter, I suspected the prisoner, who lodged at the next door, at a public house, I got constable and beadle, and went up into the prisoners along with the publican, the prisoner was in bed, we looked about the room and could see nothing, and we at last made him get up, and between the sacking and the feather bed there was this cotton apron, and the towel. I found nothing else in the room, and in the adjoining room the door of which was latched not locked, and which was an empty room, we found all the rest of the things doubled up in a feather bed. I knew the shawl particularly, because I drew the pattern for my daughter to work it; I took the prisoner next day to the justice, the things have been in my possession ever since.<br />
				Trial:  Court.<br />
				Trial: Is there a possibility of getting out of one garret window?By going along the parapet wall it is very easy, the parapet is even.<br />
				Trial: Could a man get in at the casement?Very easy.<br />
				Trial:  Walter Carwardine sworn.<br />
				Trial: I keep a public house in Red Lion Street, I have more lodgers besides the prisoner, and upon the same floor, I have an infirm old lady in the back room about eighty.<br />
				Trial: Court.<br />
				Trial: Have you any other lodgers in the house?Yes, in the two pair of stairs; I went up with Mr. Davis, he came in and asked me what lodgers I had; I said all were good but one that I did not know, that my wife took in.<br />
				Trial: Is this old lady very active?No Sir, she goes double, she is three quarters of an hour going from the top of the house to the bottom.<br />
				Trial: Did the prisoner say anything about the things?He said he did not know anything of any of the things; them are the things we found which are produced.<br />
				Trial: Prisoner. Why did not he like me.<br />
				Trial: Court. That is not evidence, unless you choose to have it so, unless you choose to put the question.<br />
				Trial: Prisoner. I choose to put the question?Because he had no box nor any thing there, and I did not go after his character, and he seemed rather a surly kind of a man.<br />
				Trial: Prisoner. Because I did not go to his house to get drunk, I always went to bed by nine oclock, he did not like me for that, and his wife asked me for the money before it was due, and I was rather surly to her.<br />
				Trial: John Freeman sworn.<br />
				Trial: It was my night to sit up at the watch-house, I went up stairs with Mr. Davis; Mr. Davis looked upon the wall to see if he could see any marks of foot-steps, but we did not, it was very dry weather; I made the man get up, and between the sacking and the bed there was an apron and towel, and I found the other things in the empty room, as they have been described; the prisoner said he knew nothing of them, but his countenance changed very much; he was not in bed though he pretended to be.<br />
				Trial: Court.<br />
				Trial: Was he or not asleep?He pretended to be asleep, but it is a thing impossible for him to be asleep, because there was so much noise in the room.<br />
				Trial: How long was it before you awoke him?About five minutes.<br />
				Trial: Did he appear to be in sleep during that time?Yes we took him to the watch-house.<br />
				Trial: Court to Miss Davis.<br />
				Trial: Are you sure the cotton apron is yours?Yes, My Lord, it is marked.<br />
				Trial:  <br />
				Trial: Prisoners Defence<br />
				I am very innocent, another person is as likely to go into the room where I slept as I was myself, the room was always open; there was one man slept with me at times.<br />
				Trial: Court to Mr. Davis<br />
				Trial: When you went up did you find his room locked?No the door was open.<br />
				Trial: Court to prisoner.<br />
				Trial: Have you any witnesses?No.<br />
				What are you?A joiner and carpenter.<br />
				Trial: Have you a master to speak for you?My master said he would come to speak for me at the justices, unknown to me, this gentleman here heard what character he gave me; there was a man slept with me at times.<br />
				Trial: Mr. Carwardine.<br />
				Trial: The man had not slept with him for two nights, and nobody was in bed in the room but the prisoner when I went up.<br />

				**********************<br />
				The First Millwright In Australia <br />
				Research by Tony Burgess. <br />
				Nathaniel Lucas was born about 1764, and in 1787 was convicted of theft in England, transported to Australia on the vessel " Scarborough" in the First Fleet; arriving in Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788. It is believed by his ancestors that being a Master Carpenter, he was "needed" to help establish the colony, so goods were planted in his lodgings and he was convicted of theft. <br />
				He was transferred to Norfolk Island, arriving in HMS Supply on 6th March 1788, with 14 other convicts, including his future wife. On 5th November 1790, he 'officially' married Olivia Gascoigne, believed to have been born in Droitwich Worcestershire in about 1760; she was also a 'First Fleeter" arriving on the vessel 'Penrhyn'. (Olivia had been sentenced to death on 5th March 1785, for 'gunpoint robbery', but later commuted to seven years transportation.) They had a total of 13 children, [twins girls were killed by a falling tree on Norfolk Island]. <br />
				On Norfolk Island, Nathaniel prospered, eventually farming seventy-five acres in his spare time; as well as supervising the construction of many of the first buildings on that island. <br />
				In 1795, Nathaniel constructed an overshot water mill on Norfolk Island for a fee of three ewe sheep, the mill having a capacity to grind and dress eighteen bushels of flour in a day. <br />
				In 1804, Governor King invited Nathaniel to return to Sydney; it is here that there are records of him constructing Flour Mills. <br />
				Nathaniel Lucas was instructed to erect a windmill for the Government on a site on Church Hill (approximately where the toll gates for the Sydney Harbour Bridge now stand.); and on completion of that he could erect another mill for himself in the Government Domain (approximately where the Shakespeare Memorial stands near the State Library of New South Wales.) <br />
				These two windmills were prefabricated in Norfolk Island and shipped to Sydney on HMS Investigator. <br />
				It is stated that these two mills of the unusual post type, which had never been built in the colony before. The upper unit, holding the propellers rotated on a post with their direction being determined by sails placed like rudders. Previous mills had generally by mechanical means after calculating the best position according to the wind. Millstones were manufactured in Norfolk Island, and stated to be 'superior in point of durability to any that can be produced here'. <br />
				The Sydney Gazette of 23rd June 1805 stated "An excellent post-mill the first that has been erected in the settlement is now completed by Mr. Nathaniel Lucas behind Black Row East. It was undertaken and finished within the space of six weeks, and has been several weeks at work. It is found capable of grinding six bushels per hour, which was, last week, accomplished for twelve hours successively." <br />
				The Sydney Gazette of 16th February 1806, states "The frame of an octagon smock mill was last week erected by Mr. Nathaniel Lucas, for the use of the Government, near the Esplanade of Fort Phillip. The height of the frame is 40 feet, and the diameter of the base, from opposite angles, 22 feet. It is to work two pair of mill stones, which are the best that could be procured at Norfolk Island, and every possible attention has been bestowed in its formation to the leading objects, real use and durability". <br />
				Nathaniel's return to Sydney was due to the death of the Colony's Superintendent of Carpenters, James Blood worth; assuming that position. After 1805, the Lucas family lived in Sydney, having a house next door to John Macarthur. (Now 1, York Street) and they operated the "Government Mill"; and at some time leased the Domain mill to Henry Kable, after which this mill was known as Kable's Post Mill. This mill was advertised for auction in the Sydney Gazette on 5th April 1807, and again on 17th August 1811. <br />
				Nathaniel and his sons constructed a number of windmills elsewhere in New South Wales, as well as numerous other timber buildings. Some of these being: At Harris Creek, near Liverpool built 1822, by John Lucas (born 1796, son of Nathaniel.) (His first flourmill). In 1824 the capacity if this mill was stated as one thousand bushels of grain weekly. At Woronora built 1825, at the head of tidal waters, sufficient to grind one thousand bushels weekly. <br />
				Wheat for this mill was at that time being grown at the 'Five Islands", and transported in shallow drift boats into which would have been levied at Sydney Cove. This mill was burnt down late in the 1830's, and was uneconomical to rebuild because by that time a Customs Officer was then stationed at Botany Bay. Today Lucas Heights is named after John and his mill. The mill estate was offered for auction on 14th march 1843, but failed to sell and was abandoned. John Lucas had been given the name of John the Miller. <br />
				The Harris Creek water mill had been built in six months, and was the first mill constructed after the arrival of Governor Brisbane; who gave permission for the mill to be called Brisbane Mill. Additional water was supplied from a reservoir close to the mill, approximately 150 acres in area. <br />
				In 1812, a son William married Sarah Squire at Ryde, the daughter of a brewer. And in 1816 they moved to Van Diemen's Land, securing a one hundred acre grant near Launceston; especially to grow hops, wheat and barley. The wheat and barley was shipped to Sydney aboard ships owned by Robert Campbell and John Palmer, and ground in Nathaniel's mill, with the barley going to the Squire Brewery. The Hodgett family owned another brewery having a similar arrangement. <br />
				Nathaniel Lucas, fell into the Georges River and was drowned in April 1818. Olivia still owned the farm in Liverpool just before she died in 1830. <br />
				A fair amount of information has survived about the Lucas family, surely our First Millwrights.
