Jane STEWART [17] was born on 9 June, 1870 (2) at Outseat, Gamrie, Banffshire, Scotland. Her parents were Alexander STEWART [59] and Margaret HAY [60].

On the Scottish census taken on 2 April 1871, Alexander can be found as a 2 year old boy living with his mother, uncle and grandmother at Knowes of Chick, Marnoch, Banff (3). On the same census, Jane can be found as a 9 month old baby living with her parents, her step-brother, older sister and older brother at Outseat, Gamrie, Banff (4). She is shown as a Crofter's daughter.

On the Scottish census taken on 3 April 1881, Alexander can be found as a 12 year old boy living with his mother, grandmother, and step-brother at North Side of Middle Street, Marnoch, Banff (5). He is listed as a scholar. On the same census, Jane is living at Outseat, Gamrie, Banff (6) with her parents, her step-brother, four of her brothers and four of her sisters. She is also listed as a scholar.

The 1891 Scottish census was taken on 5 April (7), and Alexander is found at North Everton, Monquhitter, East Aberdeenshire working as a farm servant on the farm of Mary Ironside. Jane is found working as a domestic servant and cook at the household of James and Margaret Paterson (8) in Berryhill House, Fetteresso, Cookney, Kincardineshire.

Married life
------------

Alexander and Jane were married on the 16 June 1894 (9) at Outseat, presumably at the home of Jane's mother. Unfortunately, Janes father had already died and was not able to witness the wedding. At the time of their wedding, Alexander stated that he was living at Towie, Barclay, Turriff and working as a farm servant. Jane was living at Barnyards, Delgaty, Turriff and working as a domestic servant.

Their first child Alexander RAEPER [70] was born on the 14 March 1895 (10). At the time they were living at 5 Gould Street, Turriff, Aberdeenshire and Alexander was still a farm servant.

On the 25 September 1897 (11), they had their second child Maggie RAEPER [71]. By then, they were living at 46 Fife Street, Turriff, Aberdeenshire. Alexander was an Agricultural Labourer.

Their next child Jane (or Jeanie) Brown RAEPER [71] was born on 20 August 1899 (12) at their home, Mavis of Hatton, Turriff. Alexander was described as a Labourer.

On the 1901 Scottish census, 31 March (13), the whole family were living at 9 Castlehill, Turriff. Alexander was a labourer in a quarry, and his son Alexander, and daughter Maggie, were attending school.

Their fourth child was born on 22 August 1902 (14). Her name was Agnes RAEPER [112], but she was known as Nan. She was born in the family home at 3 Gladstone Lane, Turriff. Alexander was still working as a labourer.

My grandmother, Isabella RAEPER [7] was born on the 6 April 1904 (15) at 3 Gladstone Lane, Turriff as well, and her father Alexander was still working as a labourer.

Alexander and Jane had their sixth child and second son John Gordon RAEPER [99] on the 3 December 1905 (16). They were still living at 3 Gladstone Lane in Turriff. This is the longest they had lived at any place in their life so far. Alexander was still working as a labourer.

On the 29 August 1908, their seventh and final child Mary Duncan RAEPER [118] was born (17). She was born at 3 Gladstone Lane in Turriff and her father was listed as a labourer.

The latter years
----------------

At the outbreak of the First World War on the 4 August 1914, Alexander was 45 years old and his eldest son, Alexander, was 19. By the 13 August 1914, Alexander (junior) had enlisted with the 1st Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders and was on his way to France to fight in the war. Unfortunately, on the 7 June 1915, Alexander died in a Prisoner Of War camp (18). His home address was listed as 1 Granton Place, Aberdeen, Scotland.

Four years later on 6 June 1919 (19), Jane died of heart disease in the family home at 1 Granton Place, Aberdeen. She was 48 years old. Alexander was present and described himself as a Corporation Carter.

In 1925, Alexander's second daughter Jeanie married James Taylor (20). Then in 1928, his first daughter Maggie emigrated to Melbourne, Australia (21). Unfortunately, Maggie died giving birth in Melbourne in 1933 (22). On Maggie's death certificate, Alexander was listed as a Warehouseman. In 1934 (23), my grandmother Isabella went out to Melbourne, Australia to care for the baby. Alexander was listed as still living at 1 Granton Place, Aberdeen. Later that year, Alexander's youngest daughter Mary Duncan Raeper married James Chesser Logan at the Holburn Central Parish Church in Aberdeen (25).

At the age of 77, on the 17 March 1946 (24), Alexander died of a swollen appendix and a blood clot. He died at 19 Claremont Street, Aberdeen, and on his death certficate he was apparently resident at 132 Holburn Sreet, Aberdeen. His only remaining son, John Gordon Raeper registered the death.
