St. Agnes, Cornwall

*My Cornish Faull Ancestry*
===============================================

So far, my Faull ancestry has been traced back to the early 18th Century in Cornwall.

This website starts with my Great Grandfather, John Herbert William Faull who was born in 1883 at Creswick, Victoria, Australia.
